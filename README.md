## Gnawave Release

### Short
With "Gnawave", Gats and Khalil Mounji invite us on a musical journey that transcends borders and genres, fusing Moroccan Gnawa tradition with the electrifying energy of Berlin's underground scene.
In honor of the late Maallem Said Benthami Oughassal, the revered Gnawa master whose spirit continues to inspire, "Gnawave" is a heartfelt dedication that pays homage to his enduring legacy. May he rest in peace, his influence resonates through every note and beat of this album. As we embrace the profound influence of Maallem Said Benthami Oughassal on Khalil' playing, we also recognize the importance of supporting his family, especially his 7-year-old daughter Rihanna, during this challenging time. To give back to the family of the master, we have established a fund from the proceeds of "Gnawave." We encourage our listeners and fans to contribute generously to this cause, ensuring that the future of this young talent is secure and her dreams are nurtured, just as her father's music has enriched our lives. Let us come together in unity, just as "Gnawave" unites traditions and genres, to provide tangible support to the family of a true Gnawa legend.

### Gnawave Residency: Exploring Gnawa Music alongside AI ###

Music is arguably one of the most emotional art forms, and yet it is closely interwoven with mathematical principles, sound physics and the careful crafting of musical instruments. Consequently, the evolution of music is closely linked with the history of musical instruments and the technologies used to perform, record and reproduce them. 

Gnawave is a Residency program that explores the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and music, blending human creativity with technological precision. It's a space where AI meets musical artistry, creating a unique fusion of innovation and traditional craftsmanship.

The Residency will happen before and at the Essaouira Gnawa and World Music Festival, an annual event held in Essaouira, Morocco, that celebrates the rich musical heritage of Gnawa music, a genre deeply rooted in Moroccan spiritual and cultural traditions. Established in 1998 by Moroccan entrepreneur Neila Tazi, the festival has become a significant platform for Gnawa musicians to showcase their art alongside international artists.

The Residency Programm features Moroccan and German musicians and AI developers who will collaborate to explore Gnawa music. This project aims to understand and appreciate Gnawa's unique patterns, while also examining AI's ability to learn from this musical tradition.

The goal is to facilitate a dialogue between Gnawa's timeless melodies and AI, promoting mutual learning and creative exchange. The residency is focused on understanding cultural heritage through technology.

Gnawa music, with its foundational mluk songs and role in spiritual performances, presents a repetitive and finite repertoire ideal for AI synthesis. An open-source dataset will be a key outcome of the residency. The project prioritizes understanding how local Gnawa artists can share in the benefits from AI models derived from their music, while contributing to the ongoing preservation and development of their musical heritage.

The final showcase at the Essaouria Festival will be a live jam, with German and Moroccan musicians synergizing Gnawa music and AI.

Our aim is to attract support from institutions dedicated to the intersection of culture and technology.
