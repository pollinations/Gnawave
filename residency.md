# Gnawave Residency: A Fusion of Tradition and Innovation

The Gnawave Residency is a pioneering program that bridges the gap between the ancient musical traditions of Gnawa and the futuristic possibilities of artificial intelligence. Set against the backdrop of the Essaouira Gnawa and World Music Festival, this residency represents a unique intersection of music, culture, and technology.

## Exploring Gnawa Music alongside AI

This initiative brings together Moroccan and German musicians and AI developers to delve into the essence of Gnawa music. Our goal is to foster a dialogue that enriches both the musical and technological domains, ensuring a respectful and innovative integration of Gnawa traditions with AI advancements.

Through this collaborative effort, we aim to create an open-source dataset that honors Gnawa music's cultural significance while contributing to the advancement of AI research. Join us in celebrating this fusion of heritage and innovation at the final showcase of the Essaouira Festival.
