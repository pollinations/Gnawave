Our mission is **threefold**: to promote the *endurance and worldwide recognition* of **Gnawa music** through digital innovation, to explore AI's ability to interpret and augment traditional musical forms, and to produce new artistic works incorporating AI-generated samples. This collaboration seeks to mutually benefit **cultural preservation**, **technological exploration**, and **artistic creation**.

### **Open-Source Dataset and Musical Data Visualizations** ðŸ“Š

A primary deliverable of the **Gnawave Project** is an *open-source dataset*, crucial for both **cultural heritage** and **technological exploration**. Accompanied by innovative musical data visualizations, these resources will be instrumental for ongoing research and creative projects at the nexus of music and AI. They offer insights into Gnawa music's complex rhythms and melodies, providing fresh perspectives through the visual analysis of musical structures.
